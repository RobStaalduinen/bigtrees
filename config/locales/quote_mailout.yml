        Hi %{name},

        As we discussed, your quote is attached with a firm price and all of our company information including our insurance and certificate numbers. If you'd like to go ahead with the job, don't worry about signing the document, simply confirm you'd like to go ahead with the work by replying to this email.

        The work includes: 
        a) cutting down all the trees and bushes
        b) chipping everything and removing the wood chips from the site

        If you would like us to do any extra work above and beyond what we've discussed, please let me know ahead of time. 

        We accept all forms of payment including: cheque, cash, e-transfer and debit/credit (debit and credit are an additional 3% due to machine costs). 

        We offer $50 in additional savings for allowing us to place a yard sign on your property for a month.

        Thanks,

        Tyler
