        Hi %{name},

        I didn't hear back from you regarding the tree work so I figured I would follow up just in case. Please feel free to email me or call me anytime if you have any questions. My cell is 705 943 7374 or you can reach me tolll free at 1 877 542 5551. 

        If you are interested,  there are a few ways to save some money. First, is the yard sign discount ($25) which I mentioned previously. Second there is a another discount ($25) for leaving a 5 star review online. Third is a big 15% discount if you schedule the work to be completed in December or February. 

        Once again, thanks for your time and consideration. 

        Have a great day.
